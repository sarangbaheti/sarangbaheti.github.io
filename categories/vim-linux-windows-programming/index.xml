      <description>vim vim what an editor! I am yet to find someone who used this editor but is neutral. Either folks love it or hate it. I think that is sign of a truly remarkable product, in sense it connects to core- evoking emotional reaction. It was not long ago i was in vim WTF camp. But had to spend a few weeks on linux and re-discovered vim. After about a month of usage vim is one of my preferred editors for code browsing- even on windows.</description>
