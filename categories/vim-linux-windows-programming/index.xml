&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; what an editor! I am yet to find someone who used this editor but is neutral. Either folks love it or hate it. I think that is sign of a truly remarkable product, in sense it connects to core- evoking emotional reaction. It was not long ago i was in &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; WTF camp. But had to spend a few weeks on linux and re-discovered &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;. After about a month of usage &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; is one of my preferred editors for code browsing- even on windows. :)
Learning and getting used to &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; took some time- especailly it was learning not to fight &lt;code&gt;normal&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt; mode. One my left little finger developed flesh memory of hitting &lt;code&gt;esc&lt;/code&gt; key every now and then- life became much better with vim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The other thing that makes &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt; awesome is plugin support and number of plugins available. I have been using &lt;code&gt;ctags&lt;/code&gt; for quite some time- but started using &lt;code&gt;cscope&lt;/code&gt; recently and love it. For mid sized projects it is quite fast and snappy and the code database makes all sorts of queries possible. Now that i found that it integrates well with &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;. This post is about getting &lt;code&gt;cscope&lt;/code&gt; hooked up in &lt;code&gt;vim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
